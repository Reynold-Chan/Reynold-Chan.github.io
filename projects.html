							<h2>Work Philosophy</h2>
							<p>My first internship at Arup has shaped a lot of my own personal work philosophy. I firmly stand behind <a href="https://www.arup.com/perspectives/publications/speeches-and-lectures/section/ove-arup-key-speech">Ove's Arup Key Speech</a> as a guiding principal in work.</p>

									<h3>Machine Learning Applied to Bridges - Current</h3>
									<p>My thesis project for my final year. The aim is to generate bridge designs based on inputs so designers can get a preliminary design of bridges. This is pretty exciting, since there has been very little development of AI in the field of civil engineering.</p>

									<h3>GUI Development for Seismic Design Team - Current</h3>
									<p>The project is to develop a new PyQT GUI interface for the in-house program of the Seismic Design Team at the Universtiy of Toronto. The program generates variations of tower designs based on user input to generate the most optimal tower per user's metrics. Working in a team of four, we develop this GUI in response to the static excel tables that were the previous design for the interface. It also allows users to freely more visualize the design of the tower.</p>

									<h3>GUI Development for Concrete Canoe Team - Current</h3>
									<p>This is a C++ GUI development for an in-house program using Qt designer. The program generates variations of Canoe designs based on user input. The aim is to help users have an easier access to using the canoe designer. The previous interface was purely a command line console interface.</p>

									<h3>Text Adventure Game - Finished</h3>
									<p>This is my first indepedent personal coding project. You can find the code here on the <a href="https://github.com/Reynold-Chan/TextAdventureGame">Github</a>. Interaction is done mainly through the python console and was a lot of fun to write.</p>

									<h3>Pearson International Airport - Finished</h3>
									<p>Worked on the structural design of an expansion project at the Toronto Pearson International Airport during my Arup Toronto internship. This was an amazing project with a tight deadline and small team. I learnt a lot more than the typical intern due to the small team and the amount of responsibilites placed on me. This is also my first and formal internship experience.</p>

									<h3>Londoner Macao - Finished</h3>
									<p>Project I worked on in Hong Kong Arup. It was under construction when I arrived, so a majority of the work I did involved communication with the contractors and solving unique construction problems found on site. On this job I learnt how to be an effective communicator.</p>

									<h3>Retaining Wall Study - Finished</h3>
									<p>This was a study done at the City Universtiy of Hong Kong. The aim of this study was to investigate if there was any empirical relationship in soil strength that can be translated to a more theoretical relationship. I helped the PhD student built his experiment by communicating directly with the technicians.</p>

									<h3>Single MIR Photon Detector - Finished</h3>
									<p>This was my first formal project done in the physics lab at the University of Toronto. It was a quantum optics study. I built and designed the experiment under the supervision of my supervisor. The project was finished but was never fully verified. </p>
